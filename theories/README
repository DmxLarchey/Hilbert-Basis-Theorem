This archive contains the Rocq artefact for the CPP 2026 submission

    Bar Inductive Predicates for Constructive Algebra in Rocq
    
The code was written to be compiled and reviewed using Rocq-9.0.0.
The only incompatibility with Coq (say 8.20) are in the "From StdLib"
import directives that should be replaced by "From Coq" instead,
but doing so generates warning when using Rocq.

Before reviewing the code, you should install Rocq-9.0.0. 
We suggest using the opam tool for this task. Vanilla Rocq 
(with Stdlib) is enough, no external libraries are needed. 

Once Rocq-9.0.0 is installed, unpack the archive and, in a terminal, 
from the main directory of the archive, compile the whole project with 

> make all

This should run and complete in less than 15 seconds. Some of the main 
results are purposedly displayed while they are compiled by Rocq. There
is a warning because we use the Fin.t type that some Coq/Rocq developers 
have decided to flag as "too difficult to use" (we disagree). 
 
After the code is compiled, you can review the individual files using 
your favorite Rocq visual editor, possibly rocqide. Some of these files
are heavily commented.
