The archive contains the Rocq artefact for the CPP 2026 submission

    Bar Inductive Predicates for Constructive Algebra in Rocq
    
The code was written to be compiled and reviewed using Rocq-9.0.0.
The only incompatibility with Coq (say 8.20) are in the "From StdLib"
import directives that should be replaced by "From Coq" instead.

Before reviewing the code, you should install Rocq-9.0.0 (I would
suggest using the opam tool), unpack the archive and, in a terminal;
from the main directory of the archive, compile the whole project with 

> make all

This should run and complete in less than 15 seconds. Some of
the main results are purposedly displayed while they are
compiled by Rocq.
 
After that, you can review the individual files using your
favorite Rocq editor, possibly rocqide.
