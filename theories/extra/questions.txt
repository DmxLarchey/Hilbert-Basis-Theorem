    Btw, we can derive Dickson's lemma from the HBT:
    
    to the n-uplet (p₁,...,pₙ) of N^n we associate
    the monomial X^p₁...X^pₙ in Z[X₁,...,Xₙ]. Hence
    a sequence of n-uplet gives rise to a sequence
    of monomials that cannot be forever free of linear
    combinations, according to the HBT. In turn, such
    a linear combination gives a good pair ?

    Mₚ₊₁ = A₁.M₁ + ... + Aₚ.Mₚ
    
    implies one of the M₁,..,Mₚ is lesser than Mₚ₊₁
    on all components
