(** Notice that Z[X] is "not a principal ring" because
    the ideal generated by P := 2 and Q := X is not
    principal:
   
    Let us assume that Idl [2;X] were principal, hence
    generated by some polynomial G.
    
    Hence G divides 2 so G is in {-2,-1,1,2}
    But G divides X, hence the head coefficient of G 
    divides that of X, hence G can only be either -1 or 1.
    
    So if Idl [2;X] were principal, then it would
    be generated by 1 (or -1) and hence would be 
    all of Z[X]. Hence 1 belongs to Idl [2;X]
    
    Now let us how that 1 is not a linear combination of 2 and X
    We assume U and V in Z[X] such that U.2+V.X = 1 and derive 
    a contradiction:
    
    We instanciate/evaluate X := 0, we get U(0).2 = 1 in Z
    meaning 2 would divide 1 which is the contradiction we need. 
    
    Notice that Z/pqZ with p prime and q > 1 is a principal
    ring (as a quotient ring). However (Z/pqZ)[X] is not principal
    
    Indeed, let us assume that Idl [p.X⁰;1.X¹] is a principal
    ideal. Then let G be a generator of that ideal.
    We have G divides p.X⁰ so the degree of G is less that 0
    so G = k.X⁰ for some k. Now G divides 1.X¹ so the head
    coefficient of G divides the head coefficient of 1.X¹ hence
    k divides 1. So k is invertible in Z/pqZ, ie gcd(k,pq) = 1.
    
    G is a linear combination of p.X⁰ and 1.X¹ so there is
    U,V in (Z/pqZ)[X] st p.U + X.U = kX⁰. Intanciating
    X with 0, we get p.U(0) = k. Hence p divides k and thus
    divides gcd (k,pq). So p divides 1, hence cannot be prime.
    
    Thm: Z/mZ is principal. But (Z/mZ)[X] is principal if and
         only if Z/mZ is a field, ie m is prime.

    Btw, we can derive Dickson's lemma from the HBT:
    
    to the n-uplet (p₁,...,pₙ) of N^n we associate
    the monomial X^p₁...X^pₙ in Z[X₁,...,Xₙ]. Hence
    a sequence of n-uplet gives rise to a sequence
    of monomials that cannot be forever free of linear
    combinations, according to the HBT. In turn, such
    a linear combination gives a good pair ?

    implies one of the M₁,..,Mₚ is lesser than Mₚ₊₁
