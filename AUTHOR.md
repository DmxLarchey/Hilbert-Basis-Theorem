## Author

The _Hilbert Basis Theorem in Coq_ project is developed by:
- [Dominique Larchey-Wendling](https://members.loria.fr/DLarchey/files/) (<dominique.larchey-wendling@loria.fr>), CNRS researcher in the TYPES team at LORIA.

It is a standalone project but inspired by the work in the [`Coq-Kruskal`](https://github.com/DmxLarchey/Coq-Kruskal),
and a complement to the [Buchberger](https://github.com/rocq-community/buchberger) project.
